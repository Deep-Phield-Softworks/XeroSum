XeroSum
=======

Isometric, Squad-Based, Real-Time Strategy RPG in a smooth scrolling infinite and randomly generated world.  

We concieved the idea for Xero Sum in the Summer of 2013. Work began right away but has undergone several lapses in 
progress throughout that time since. As of right now, we are actively working.

Xero Sum is being developed in Python, utilizing the open source Pygame game development library. Game development in 
Python is not an extremely common practice so the project provides it's fair share of challenges. We enjoy the power
and flexibility Python offers however, and are proving to ourselves (and some others :)) that it is not only possible, but
that the results can be quite impressive.

As an open source repository we invite you to peruse through this code at your leisure. You are even welcome to 
lend a hand with any code you'd like to contribute. Please send an e-mail to either me ( CToups89@gmail.com ) or Eric
( EFedrowisch@yahoo.com ) before-hand however, as certain issues/bugs/improvements may be either already underway or
gotten rid of completely.

Xero Sum uses the python module pygame to draw to the screen. You can get pygame from:

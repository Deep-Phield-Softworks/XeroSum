    <br>
    <big><b>Brief Tutorial</b></big><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Xero Sum is
    divided into two main parts. There is main.py that executes the main
    program loop and the data object types that store the data and
    reflect changes in the state of the game world. One could also make
    and display a world using their own version of main.py. In this
    tutorial we will create a Xero Sum World object and use a WorldView
    object to draw it to the screen.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    -First create a new python file in the same directory as the Xero
    Sum. I am going to call my file “demo.py” and will leave it in the
    main directory of Xero Sum.<br>
    -The first few lines we will need to import the modules and classes
    we need.<br>
    <br>
    <i>import pygame, sys</i><i><br>
    </i><i>from AoE import *</i><i><br>
    </i><i>from World import World</i><i><br>
    </i><i>from WorldView import WorldView</i><i><br>
    </i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pygame is the renderer used to
    draw to the screen. We will also import sys, which is standard
    python module. We will use sys to exit the program more gracefully.
    After the first line we have some Xero Sum specific modules: AoE,
    World and WorldView. World is the object that stores all the other
    game obejcts. It controls the database to store and retrieve these
    objects. WorldView is an object that takes an area of the World
    object and gathers all the data needed to display that area of the
    World. AoE (short for Area of Effect) is a module that defines Shape
    objects. Shape objects are a convenient way to store lists of
    coordinates. WorldView objects use Shapes to define the set of
    Coordinates of the view.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, we will have some lines
    of code for initialization of the Pygame display surface. Before
    anything can be drawn we have to initialize pygame and tell it the
    size of the display we want.<br>
    <br>
    <i>pygame.init()</i><i><br>
    </i><i>SCREEN_SIZE = [pygame.display.Info().current_w,
      pygame.display.Info().current_h]</i><i><br>
    </i><i>SCREEN = pygame.display.set_mode(SCREEN_SIZE,
      pygame.FULLSCREEN)</i><i><br>
    </i><br>
    Now, we come to some more Xero Sum specific lines of code.<i><br>
    </i><i><br>
    </i><i>WORLD = World("DEMO")</i><i><br>
    </i><i>originKey = '0_0_0'</i><i><br>
    </i><i>cubeargs = {'origin': originKey, 'magnitude': [10,10,0],
      'towardsNegInf': False}</i><i><br>
    </i><i>shape = Cube(**cubeargs)</i><i><br>
    </i><i>VIEW = WorldView(WORLD, shape, SCREEN_SIZE)</i><br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We make a World Object and
    name it “DEMO”. This does more than is readily apparent. It also
    creates a python shelve object to use as a database. The name of the
    shelve object will be "World Name" + "Shelf". Or "DEMOShelf" in this
    example. We will also need a coordinate to be the center or focus of
    the WorldView object we will be making. I choose X=0, Y=0, Z=0 and
    store these three values in a string named originKey. Each of the
    axes' value is seperated by an underscore. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I create a dictionary of
    arguments to be used in creating a Shape object. Most objects in
    Xero Sum are created in this manner. A dictionary of values are made
    and then an object is created using them. This approach facilitates
    useful inheritance as the same dictionary can be passed from each
    object class to it's parent class and each class can be made to use
    the arguments stored in keys that pertain to it and ignore the rest.
    The length of the dictionary can also be kept short if each class is
    given default values to use in the case that the dictionary doesn't
    override those defaults.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shape being created has an
    origin at "0_0_0", a magnitude (or size) of 10x10x0(really becomes
    10x10x1) and the "towardsNegInf" argument places the origin in the
    center of the shape, rather than at the "bottom left" corner of it.
    Now, we make the Shape usign the Cube class constructor and the
    cubeargs dictionary. Then we create our WorldView object and store
    it in the variable VIEW.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When VIEW is initialized, it
    does some things behind the scenes. It takes the Shape it was given
    and determines which Chunks of the World are involved and it adds
    those Chunks to the dictionary of active Chunks stored by the World.
    It also creates a pygame Surface to render onto and which we will
    later draw to the display. We could display VIEW at this point, but
    there would be nothing to see until we fill the World with some
    terrain and objects.<br>
    <br>
    <i>#Fill active chunks in VIEW with terrain</i><i><br>
    </i><i>baseTerrain = {'imageKey': 'grass.png'}</i><i><br>
    </i><i>rocks = {'imageKey':'rocks.png', 'speedModifier': 1.25,
      'layer': 1.0}</i><i><br>
    </i><i>bushes = {'imageKey': 'bush.png', 'speedModifier': 1.50,
      'layer': 1.1}</i><i><br>
    </i><i>for key in sorted(WORLD.active.keys()):</i><i><br>
    </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      WORLD.baseTerrainChunkFill(key, **baseTerrain)</i><i><br>
    </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      WORLD.randomFillChunkFeature(key, **rocks)</i><i><br>
    </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      WORLD.randomFillChunkFeature(key, **bushes)</i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make the World more
    interesting, we create a few dictionaries of arguments describing
    various types of terrain. In this case, a grassy base terrain to go
    down first and then some rocks and bushes for flavor. We then pass
    each one of these arguments of dictionaries to a method of WORLD so
    that it can add them to the database as appropriate. We pass the
    arguments rather than an object so that each rock or bush can be
    created and stored as a unique object. We use an iteration throught
    the active Chunks by key to add the desired terrain features to each
    Chunk.<br>
    <br>
    <i>#Render the VIEW now that there is somethign to see</i><i><br>
    </i><i>VIEW.render()</i><i><br>
    </i><i>SCREEN.blit(VIEW.surface, (0,0))</i><i><br>
    </i><i>pygame.display.flip() </i><i><br>
    </i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we have a VIEW
    populated with terrain to draw, we use the render method of VIEW to
    cause it to draw all the on screen objects to its own pygame Surface
    and then we blit VIEWs' Surface to the SCREEN. Finally, we have
    pygame flip the display to refresh the physical screen's display. If
    we ran the demo.py at this point it would likely draw to the screen
    and then disappear before we had a chance to see much of anything.
    We need a simple main control loop to keep the program running until
    we wish to exit it.<br>
    <br>
    <i>#Main control loop</i><i><br>
    </i><i>while True:</i><i><br>
    </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for event in pygame.event.get():#Go
      through all events</i><i><br>
    </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if event.type ==
      pygame.QUIT: #If the little x in the window was clicked...</i><i><br>
    </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      WORLD.close()</i><i><br>
    </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      sys.exit()</i><i><br>
    </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if event.type ==
      pygame.KEYDOWN:</i><i><br>
    </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      pressed_keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()</i><i><br>
    </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      if pressed_keys[pygame.K_ESCAPE]:</i><i><br>
    </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      WORLD.close()</i><i><br>
    </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      sys.exit() &nbsp;</i><br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this control loop in the
    code, the World is created and drawn once. Then the progam waits
    until the Escape key is pressed to exit. Now we can actually see
    what we have made. Each time we run the demo.py there will be more
    and more terrain added. If we wish to delete the World and start
    over again, we must find the "DEMOShelf" file and delete that as it
    contains the World's database. Then, a new database will be created
    the next time the demo.py is run.<br>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main.py is the entry point
    into the execution of Xero Sum. When run it will change the path
    variable to the file directory where main.py resides. This is
    necessary so that it can find expected files relative to that
    absolute path (Xero Sum imports, game resources, etc).<br>
    main.py is divided into four major sections that occur roughly in
    this linear order in the file:<br>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;import statements<br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;main loop definition<br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;user inputs definitions<br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;world initialization<br>
    <br>

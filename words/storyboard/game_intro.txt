*Just ideas here. It’s hard to do this without real content down already. The order of things and whether anything stays are of course subject to change.*

 

The year is 2634 *(subject to change who cares)*. Humanity and it’s known offshoots can only be found here on the planet *name*. Once home to technologically progressive human settlements known as Commonwealth’s *(better name?)*, the planet has been devastated by a century long conflict involving four *(next-evolutionary-step-humans is what I wanna say here. How do I say that?)*. Seventy-four years after the wars, all forms of humanity struggle daily to carve out an existence.


Today is your first day as leader *(better word for that maybe? Something unique that squad leaders are called)* of your tribe *(better word than tribe)*.

Your name is ______  ___   _______  *(first middle last)*. Those closest to you sometimes call you ______ *(nickname)*. 

Most of your *tribe* left following the death of it’s old leader. You are left with three of your closest friends and advisors.
*Here it’d be cool to pick those three right? Like, a sniper, a demo guy, an engineer what have you. They could pick from a pool of potential people, maybe 9 people or so. These three could be really important and would really give an emotional impact when they die. That kinda thing. Just an idea.*

*After you pick the crew, maybe there’s a pause for a second, then a new screen:*

The old legends speak vaguely of another star system from which baseline humanity may have originated. 

*Another pause, new screen:*

A single main sequence sun and a blue paradise Aerth.
